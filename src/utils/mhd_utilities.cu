 * \author Robert 'Bob' Caddy (rvc@pitt.edu)
 * \brief Contains the implementation of various utility functions for MHD and
 * for the various kernels, functions, and tools required for the 3D VL+CT MHD
 * integrator. Due to the CUDA/HIP compiler requiring that device functions be
 * directly accessible to the file they're used in most device functions will be
 * implemented in the header file
